## ❓ Notes & Tips

- ✅ Inputs are **case-sensitive** and must follow the **exact syntax** shown in examples.
- 🧮 Merchant discount can be written as `1.5%` or simply `1.5`.
- 🧠 The application uses **in-memory storage** — no database setup is required.
- 🔚 To exit the CLI, type one of the following:
  - `exit`
  - `quit`
  - `stop`
